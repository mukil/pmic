# ProMUT Indicator Repository

The ProMUT Indicator Repository is a research & development effort in Work Package 3 of the [ProMUT Junior Research Group](http://purl.org/promut), IASS Potsdam.

The initial idea for this repository was developed as a contribution to the [EnvirInfo 2019](https://enviroinfo2019.org/) workshop on the [Future of Environmental Informatics Research from the Perspective of Young Researchers](https://enviroinfo2019.org/workshops/#track3).
